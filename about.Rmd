<img src = "policywonk.jpg" style="width:47%; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> I graduated from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/), a small liberal arts college in Minnesota, with a dual major in political science and history. In Minnesota, I worked as a policy intern/legislative aide for several state-level politicians, including [State Senator Foung Hawj](https://www.senate.mn/members/member_bio.html?mem_id=1213) and later [Former Govenor Mark B. Dayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dayton). My duties included analysis and evaluation of state legislation that impacted Minnesota's disadvantaged ethnic communities, such as Somali, Hmong, and Lao peoples.

I moved to Washington DC in 2014 to pursue a [Master of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/) degree at Georgetown University. After my graduation from Georgetown in 2016, I worked as a policy analyst/consultant with a number of think tanks and lobby firms in the Greater Capital Area including the [Navigant Consulting](https://guidehouse.com/), the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/), and the [Margolis Center](https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/) at Duke University.

Since Fall 2018, I have been a PhD student in the Political Science Department at UW-Madison, specializing in authoritarian politics with a regional focus on East Asia. Please find my academic [CV](cv.pdf) and [research page](research.html) here.
