<img src = "policywonk.jpg" style="width:47%; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> I graduated from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/), a small liberal arts college in Minnesota, with a dual major in history and political science. While in Minnesota I worked as a policy intern/legislative aide to several state-level politicians, including [State Senator Foung Hawj](https://www.macalester.edu/) and later, [Former Govenor Mark B. Dayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dayton). My duties included analysis and evaluation of state legislation that impacted Minnesota's disadvantaged ethnic communities, such as Somali, Hmong, and Lao peoples.

I went to Washington DC in 2014 to pursue a [Master of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/) degree at Georgetown University. After my graduation from Georgetown in 2016, I worked as a policy analyst/consultant with a number of think tanks and lobby firms in Washington, DC, including the [Navigant Consulting](https://guidehouse.com/), the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/), and the [Robert J. Margolis, MD, Center](https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/) at Duke University.

Since Fall 2018, I have been a PhD student in the Political Science Department, specializing in non-democratic politics with a regional focus on East Asia. My academic [CV](cv.pdf) is here. For my current research, see my [research page](research.html).
