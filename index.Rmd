Welcome! I am an [Earl S. Johnson Postdoctoral Instructor in Political Science](https://mapss.uchicago.edu/directory/juan-qian) at the University of Chicago. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am a comparative politics scholar with a regional focus on China and East Asia. My research interest lies in the intersection of elite and bureaucratic politics, authoritarian policymaking dynamics, and comparative political economy in both historical and contemporary contexts.

My book manuscript, titled *[Statebuilding by Campaign: The Making and Shaking of Modern Chinese Bureaucracy](dissertation.html)*, studies the various tactics and mechanisms employed by the Chinese regime to motivate and control subordinate bureaucrats during major political and policy campaigns from 1949 to 1976. In addition, my research has been published in peer-reviewed journals including *[Comparative Politics](https://doi.org/10.5129/001041524X17069685289697)*, *[The China Quarterly](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0305741023000644)*, and *[Ethnopolitics](https://doi.org/10.1080/17449057.2021.2001954)*.

My research has won several prestigious grants and awards, including [NSF-APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant](https://politicalsciencenow.com/meet-jingyuan-qian-2021-apsa-doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grantee/), [MPSA Pi Sigma Alpha Best Paper Award](https://www.mpsanet.org/professional-resources/awards/2024-award-recipients/), [China Times Cultural Foundation Young Scholar Award](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20211002000028-260405?chdtv), and [Best Dissertation Prize in Comparative Politics at UW-Madison](https://polisci.wisc.edu/2023/10/27/congratulations-to-the-departments-best-dissertation-prize-winners-for-2023/).
