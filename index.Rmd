Welcome. My name is Juan Qian, and I am a PhD student in the [Political Science Department](https://polisci.wisc.edu/) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My major fields are comparative politics and methodology. 

My research focuses on the historical political economy of China. Broadly speaking, I am interested in three topics: (1) the evolution of Chinese political institutions over time; (2) the long-term impact of historical events on contemporary behaviors, attitudes, and institutions; (3) the relationship and tension between the Party and the State.

Before coming to Wisconsin, I graduated from [Macalester College](http://www.macalester.edu) with a B.A. in political science in 2014 and obtained my Master of Public Policy from [Georgetown University](http://www.georgetown.edu) in 2016. Between 2016 and 2018, I worked as a Senior Research Assistant at Duke University's [Margolis Center](http://healthpolicy.duke.edu).

I welcome any advice and feedback about my research work. If you would like to reach me in person, please do not hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:jqian3@wisc.edu).
