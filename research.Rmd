1.["Campaign-Style Personnel Management: Task Responsiveness and Selective Delocalization during China's Anti-Corruption Crackdown,"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4219395) with Feng Tang. 2023. *The China Quarterly*. 

**Very Short Summary:** During Xi's Anti-Corruption Campaign, provincial Party chiefs strategically appoint outside officials without local experience to govern cities with high-level corruption scandals. Their motivation for doing so is to (1) display allegiance to the Center's agenda; (2) increase hierarchical control and oversight over the corruption-affected bureaucracy. We then evaluate the effects of this appointment pattern.

2."[Historical Ethnic Conflicts and the Rise of Islamophobia in Modern China.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17449057.2021.2001954?journalCode=reno20)" 2021. *Ethnopolitics*. 1-26.

**Very Short Summary:** Historical anti-Muslim sentiment can pass down inter-generationally and influence a society's contemporary attitudes towards Muslims. Chinese people who reside in places where [Hui Muslims rebelled in 19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_Revolt_(1862%E2%80%931877)) tend to hold significantly more negative views towards Muslims in contemporary era. Modern-day Chinese authorities in the 20th century often leveraged this sentiment to justify and strengthen political control.

1.["The Zeal of the Outgroup: Loyalty Signaling and Bureaucratic Compliance in China’s Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957–1958),"](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jingyuan-Qian/publication/357181235_The_Zeal_of_the_Outgroup_Loyalty_Signaling_and_Bureaucratic_Compliance_in_China's_Anti-Rightist_Campaign_1957-1958/links/6213b988f02286737cb2985d/The-Zeal-of-the-Outgroup-Loyalty-Signaling-and-Bureaucratic-Compliance-in-Chinas-Anti-Rightist-Campaign-1957-1958.pdf) with Steve Bai. (Revise and Resubmit, *Comparative Politics*)

**Very Short Summary:** During repressive campaigns, subordinate officials who belonged to disfavored outgroups or had a "stained" personal background tended to show greater fervency in executing the leader's coercive tasks in order to credibly signal their loyalty to the leader. We use a mass purge in 1957 to explore how this incentive could lead to geospatial variation in coercion.
