### Research Statement: Statebuilding, defined as collective choice
<img src="maoposter.jpeg" style="width:23%; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> Statebuilding is essentially the establishment and consolidation of authority. A ruler's authority, however, cannot arise out of thin air, but must depend on the continued consent and complicity of their subjects. In this sense, I understand statebuilding as the result of a series of collective decisions made by the ruler, subordinate elites, and ordinary citizens altogether. What determines the outcome of statebuilding, hence, is the ruler's ability to design proper incentives and restraints to induce the compliance of their subordinates to the newly established order.

My research agenda is built upon a strand of existing scholarly works. Works that directly inspire my research agenda include: [Buchanan and Tullock (1965)](https://www.econlib.org/library/Buchanan/buchCv3.html); [Huntington and Moore eds. (1970)](https://contemporarythinkers.org/samuel-huntington/book/authoritarian-politics-in-modern-society-the-dynamics-of-established-one-party-systems/); [Ostrom (1990)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/governing-the-commons/7AB7AE11BADA84409C34815CC288CD79); [Olson (1993)](https://datascience.iq.harvard.edu/files/gov2126/files/olson_1993.pdf); [Acemoglu and Robinson (2001)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/4121); [Bruce Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/logic-political-survival); [Ghandi and Przeworski (2007)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414007305817); [Magaloni (2008)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414007313124); [Egorov and Sonin (2011)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2011.01033.x); [Svolik (2012)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/politics-of-authoritarian-rule/7F78A8828A5714F0BE74E44A90A44868); [Gehlbach and Simpser (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12122), among many others. 

What my research differs from previous works, however, is that I focus on the *emergence* and *stabilization* of autocracies at the early stages of power consolidation. Just like democratization can succeed or fail, *autocratization* can also yield diverging outcomes. Why some aspiring rulers successfully consolidate their rule, while others fall in disgrace, is the focus of my research program.

#### Dissertation: "Statebuilding by Campaign: Power Consolidation in Mao's China"

<img src="redsun.jpeg" style="width:25%; margin-right: 20px" align="right"> **Summary**: In the first three decades of the People’s Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) launched a series of mass-mobilized, coercive political campaigns aiming to alter China’s socioeconomic structure and eliminate alleged challengers of the regime. How have these campaigns shaped China’s political trajectory? My dissertation project will analyze the short- and long-term effects of Mao’s coercive political campaigns on various political actors. More specifically, I hope to answer the following questions: how could participation in coercive campaigns affect an official’s loyalty and dependence on the ruler? Did harsher implementation of those campaigns make them more or less reliant on the ruler later in their careers? Furthermore, what role did ordinary citizens play during Mao’s mass-mobilized campaigns? Was their participation involuntary and passive, or could they somehow leverage those campaigns to restrain local officials and advance their collective interests? Could the experience of mass mobilization pass down inter-generationally and shape the political participation patterns of contemporary Chinese citizens? 

My dissertation will propose a theoretical framework for understanding those questions, and will focus on three major campaigns in Maoist China – the Land Reform (1949 – 54), the Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957 – 59), and the Cultural Revolution (1966 – 76) – to validate my theory.

"Historical Ethnic Conflicts and the Rise of Islamophobia in Modern China." 2021. Forthcoming in *Ethnopolitics*. [[pdf]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17449057.2021.2001954)

**Summary:** This paper is adapted from my [undergraduate honors thesis in 2014](https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/history_honors/27/), originally titled **"Too Far from Mecca, Too Close to Peking."** In this paper, I show that narratives of 19th-century historical conflicts between the Han Chinese and Muslims have been deployed to justify anti-Muslim sentiment and practices in modern and contemporary Northwest China. My study analyses Han Chinese narratives during and after the Northwest Muslim Rebellion -- the largest ethnic conflict in nineteenth-century China. The historical narratives about the rebellion have been passed down inter-generationally and have been reiterated and reconstructed to fuel contemporary bias against Muslims in the twentieth century and beyond. My study contributes to the debate of Chinese Islamophobia by revealing how narratives of ethnic conflicts could help legitimize hostility against Muslims in modern-day China.

**TL;DR:** Anti-Muslim sentiment can pass down inter-generationally. Chinese people who reside in places where Muslims rebelled in 19th century tend to hold significantly more negative views towards Muslims in modern and contemporary era.

"The Zeal of the Outgroup: Loyalty Signaling and Bureaucratic Compliance in China’s Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957–1958)" with Steve Bai. (Under Review)

**Summary:** One puzzle that haunts comparative politics scholars is the variation in the intensity of state coercion in authoritarian regimes. Why are some bureaucrats more heavy-handed in their use of force than others? In this paper, we propose a novel theory to explain the unevenness of bureaucratic compliance in coercive policy implementation. We argue that bureaucrats whose backgrounds are not trusted by the leader tend to implement repressive tasks more fervently in order to credibly signal their loyalty to the autocrat. We provide evidence for our theory using a unique dataset from China's Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957-1958), a coercive campaign launched by Chairman Mao Zedong against alleged critics of his rule. We find that officials who were former undercover partisans, a faction considered untrustworthy by Mao, tended to prosecute a larger fraction of alleged “rightists” in their jurisdictions and assign harsher penalties. Our study contributes to the existing literature by revealing the underlying motivation of coercive agents.

**TL;DR:** Subordinate officials who belonged to disfavored outgroups or had a "stained" background tended to behave more radically in executing the autocrat's repressive tasks.

"Campaign-Style Personnel Management: Task Responsiveness and Selective Delocalization during China's Anti-Corruption Crackdown" with Feng Tang (Revise & Resubmit).

**Summary:** The Anti-Corruption Campaign launched by President Xi Jinping has been one of the most far-reaching bureaucratic overhaul in modern Chinese history. How has Xi’s anti-corruption crackdown shaped bureaucratic selection at sub-provincial level? In this paper, we find that the purge has influenced the provincial Party chiefs’ toleration of local embeddedness in their appointment of prefecture city leaders. While it is common for provincial Party chiefs to appoint locally embedded officials to govern localities without high-profile corruption cases, they tend to appoint non-local, unfamiliar officials to lead prefecture-level cities whose ex-leaders had recently been prosecuted for corruption. We argue that the provincial chiefs’ divergent attitudes toward local official embeddedness are driven by two factors: an upward-facing need for virtue signaling to their superiors, and a downward-facing incentive to strengthen hierarchical control. Using an original dataset of all Party secretaries from China’s 287 prefecture-level cities between 2013 and 2020, we find significant divergence in the local embeddedness of officials who are appointed to replace corrupt ex-leaders and those who fills the vacancies of transferred or retired predecessors. Our study sheds light on how Xi’s Anti-Corruption Campaign has reshaped the central-local relations and the logic of political control in China.

**TL;DR:** Provincial Party chiefs have an anti-local bias in the appointment of local leaders in cities that suffered from corruption scandals.
