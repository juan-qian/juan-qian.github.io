#### Teaching Political Economy to Chinese Undergrads

<img src="teaching.jpeg" style="width:30%; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> In the summer of 2018, I taught at Beijing's [Veritas Academy](https://www.veritaschina.org), where I introduced basic concepts of political economy to an outstanding group of Chinese high schoolers and undergrads. My course covers basic tenets of political economy since Adam Smith and David Ricardo; prominent public choice thinkers such as Gordon Tullock, James M. Buchanan, and Lin Ostrom; and recent theoretical advances in statebuilding and democratization research. When teaching political economy, I consider myself a purveyor of knowledge, rather than a missionary or preacher of a religion.
